# Solaris
A 2D space exploration game made with C++ and SFML.
SFML required to run this program.
This is sort of like a revamp/upgrade to my previous unfinished game.

It is under development, but you can still download it and run it on your machine to try!
P.S. It took a lot of braincells to get SFML working on our machines, so just heads up :P
